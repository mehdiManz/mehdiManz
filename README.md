Hello!

I'm Mehdi, and I wear two hats: I'm a Full Stack Developer and a Computer Technician. I'm skilled in various programming languages and frameworks, which helps me create websites and applications that work really well. ðŸ’¼

As a Full Stack Developer, I love learning and keeping up with what's new in the tech world. This helps me build modern solutions for my clients. I take my technical skills and mix them with my creative thinking to make apps and sites that are easy to use and do what businesses need, all while making users happy.

But that's not allâ€”I'm also good at fixing computer problems. I can quickly find and solve technical issues, making sure things run smoothly.

Right now, I'm looking for cool opportunities to join awesome teams and bring my skills to cool projects. If you're looking for someone who loves making great websites and knows how to handle tech troubles, I'd love to chat about how I can help your company. ðŸ’ª

Feel free to email me at mehdimaanz@gmail.com or my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-abdolnabi-zadeh-916b13287/ ðŸ“«. I'm excited about the idea of working together and using my skills to make your business succeed.

Thanks for reading my message. I can't wait to see how we can work together on some really cool stuff! âœ¨
